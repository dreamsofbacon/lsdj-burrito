// 50-100 ms behind the clock, which also smooths out the browser's timing). LSDj's PROJECT › SYNC must be MIDI.
//   startClock: the page is the clock. A tempo, Start / Stop / Continue, and 24 clocks a beat to every target, sent
//     with Web MIDI timestamps a little ahead (LOOKAHEAD_MS), so a busy page doesn't make the tempo wobble. The
//     scheduler is woken by a Worker: browsers slow a hidden tab's timers to once a second, not a Worker's messages.
//   startRelay: one FM-1 leads (LSDj SYNC = LSDJ, CLOCK OUT USB) and the page passes its clock and Start / Stop on to
//     the others as they arrive. The followers play a SYNC DELAY behind the leader.
// A target is anything with send(data, timestamp) (a Web MIDI output); one whose send throws is dropped. A target
// added with {timed: false} ignores timestamps (the virtual FM-1's output): it gets each message when it is due.
